# DEPRECATED. Please use [Verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb) instead.

grunt-readme was pretty useful, but it was buggy and too limited in scope to be worth _really_ digging in and making it awesome. 

[Verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb) is a new project that, while sharing the same roots and inspiration as grunt-reamde, is far more powerful, flexible and can be used globally from the command line.
